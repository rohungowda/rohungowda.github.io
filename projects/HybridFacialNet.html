                        &nbsp &nbsp I was always fascinated with AI. I started learning about machine and deep learning, even going on to build models like Support Vector Machines, TextCNNs,
                        Gaussian Mixture Models, etc.. It was around this time that LLMs also started making headlines. The first time I saw Chat-GPT, I genuinely believed
                        that we had reached Generative AI! A couple of years passed and now I learned lot more about AI, I still think its amazing what they can do, but now I was able to see the
                        problems these models had. One model was the Vision Transformer, which I noticed lacked the ability to capture spatial context data. It, on the other hand, captured
                        global data very well. Research into this area was limited, so I decided to delve into this area and try my hand at it. Hence HybridFacialNet was born.
                      </p>

                        <p>
                        &nbsp &nbsp My goal was to create a facial recognition model that could outperform the current state of models. Through this project I delved not only into the 
                        mathmetics of famous research papers like the Vision Tranformer, the Sequential Layer, ArcFace Loss, etc... but also learned how to build them from scratch using
                        nothing but pytorch, pen, and paper. I learned how to train, finetune, and test these models; Most importantly, I learned not to stay on any setback too long, for there
                        were too many to count. This project was a great experience and allowed me to grow my AI knowledge and technical skills by leaps and bounds. It is a project that I am proud
                        of. Please take the time to read my research paper down below, you can read in frame or feel free to download my paper. Also feel free to check out the github! I believe 
                        that while I did not reach state of the art performance, my project has intresting insights into vision transformer architectures and the 
                        task of not only facial recognition but object classification.
