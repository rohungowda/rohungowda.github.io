              <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp During my internship at La-Z-Boy, I was doing some research on building RAG pipeline and one of the areas I was looking into was streaming data through web sockets. 
                While I decided not to go with the approach, it got me thinking: could I use this somehow to create something cool? Turns out websockets are used for a whole variety of things, one of
                them being for chat applications. With this idea in mind, I decided to try building a chat application. This project was a bit different than the others, as it was more of 
                an organic approach, just seeing where it goes. I spent some time building and testing with Node.js and Socket.io and I got a really good chat feature going. I, realized, then that
                I needed somewhere to store messages, so I turned to redis for the database, mainly because it was in-memory, so really fast. That's
                actually where the name came from, an app that has blazingly fast messaging. While working on the app, I realized that I needed to authenticate users: If anyone connected
                to a websocket they could send any message. So I set up a simple username and password system so that only authenticated users could join a chat room and send messages.
              </p>

             <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp Looking back now, building a pipeline to process the messages actually was harder than setting up the websockets. I built a pipeline using a Bull Queue,
                and asychronous callbacks so that the queue wouldn't get blocked by a bottleneck operation. I also experimented with write-through cacheing using Redis, and using
                MongoDB as a database. Overall, it was a fun project and I got to learn a lot about web sockets, authentication, cacheing, and working with databases like Redis and MongoDB.
                I also created an interactive frontend with React! Please check out the repo if you are intrested in looking at the code and see the video above for a demo.
