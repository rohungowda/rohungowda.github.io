              <p>
                  &nbsp &nbsp Ever since I started exploring Distribruted Systems, I've been captivated by the intricacies of how massive volumes of data are managed,
                  processed, and stored. It was unfathomable, to me, that we could not only move this much data, but analyze and query it to gain insightful
                  information. My journey into building OrbitStore, then, was just a natural branch of this curiosity. I began reading the DynamoDB paper to
                  learn more how consistent hashing and handling replications in production systems. I analyzed the Cassandra and LevelDB databases, eager to
                  understand them and how they translated the theoreticalc concepts I was learning into reality. I was determined not just to learn, but to build.
              </p>

              <p>
                  &nbsp &nbsp This project in being built in C++, where I am trying to use as few libraries as possible. This means the memory management, the memory buffers,
                  the SSTables, LSM trees, multithreading clients, connection pools, etc... all of it is being built from scratch. It is definitely a labour intensive
                  task that combiens both research and application. I have had to go back to the drawing board back again and again. However, I find myself
                  learning more and more with each setback. I am incredibly excited about this project and I will continue to learn and build from a one node system to
                  a multinode. My only goal here is just to learn and grow. Please check out my repository on github and if anyone has any advice, I would love feedback
                  of any kind. Finding the right path for this project has been like finding a needle in a haystack, a very fun haystack, but a haystack nonetheless.
